"Iacta" is a Latin word that means "the die" or "the die is cast." It is famously attributed to Julius Caesar when he crossed the Rubicon River in 49 BC, marking a point of no return in his conflict with Pompey and the Roman Senate. The phrase "alea iacta est" (the die is cast) signifies a decision that has been made and cannot be undone, implying a moment of decisive action and commitment to a course of action.
In modern usage, "iacta" or "alea iacta est" is sometimes quoted to emphasize a significant and irreversible decision or action.
