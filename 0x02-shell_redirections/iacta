The phrase "Alea iacta est," Latin for "The die is cast," is attributed to Julius Caesar by the Roman historian Suetonius. 
On January 10, 49 BC, Caesar uttered this phrase as he led his army across the Rubicon River, thereby defying the Roman Senate and initiating a civilwar against Pompey and the Optimates.
This bold move marked a point of no return, symbolizing irrevocable decisions with significant consequences.
The phrase has since been adopted into various languages, symbolizing decisive, irreversible actions.
